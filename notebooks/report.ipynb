The goal is to find an independent set S⊆V in G such that ∑v∈Sc(v)≤B, which maximizes the total weight ∑v∈Sw(v). Since the problem on general graphs cannot be approximated within ratio |V|1−ε for any ε>0, BMWIS has attracted significant attention on graph families for which a maximum weight independent set can be computed in polynomial time. Two notable such graph families are bipartite and perfect graphs. BMWIS is known to be NP-hard on both of these graph families; however, the best possible approximation guarantees for these graphs are wide open.\n",
    "In this paper, we give a tight 2-approximation for BMWIS on perfect graphs and bipartite graphs. In particular, we give We a (2−ε) lower bound for BMWIS on bipartite graphs, already for the special case where the budget is replaced by a cardinality constraint, based on the Small Set Expansion Hypothesis (SSEH). For the upper bound, we design a 2-approximation for BMWIS on perfect graphs using a Lagrangian relaxation based technique. Finally, we obtain a tight lower bound for the capacitated maximum weight independent set (CMWIS) problem, the special case of BMWIS where w(v)=c(v) ∀v∈V. We show that CMWIS on bipartite and perfect graphs is unlikely to admit an efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme (EPTAS). Thus, the existing PTAS for CMWIS is essentially the best we can expect.`\n",

    "`Recently Chen and Poor initiated the study of learning mixtures of linear dynamical systems. While linear dynamical systems already have wide-ranging applications in modeling time-series data, using mixture models can lead to a better fit or even a richer understanding of underlying subpopulations represented in the data. In this work we give a new approach to learning mixtures of linear dynamical systems that is based on tensor decompositions. As a result, our algorithm succeeds without strong separation conditions on the components, and can be used to compete with the Bayes optimal clustering of the trajectories. Moreover our algorithm works in the challenging partially-observed setting. Our starting point is the simple but powerful observation that the classic Ho-Kalman algorithm is a close relative of modern tensor decomposition methods for learning latent variable models. This gives us a playbook for how to extend it to work with more complicated generative models.`\n",

In the abstract, seeing vocabs that are close to other categories other than their own vocab may lead to these inaccuracies.\n",

We prove a worst-case complexity result, which we believe captures this challenge: Modifying the probabilities or the reward of a single state-action pair in a reinforcement learning problem requires an amount of time almost as large as the number of states in order to keep the value function up to date, unless the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH) is false; SETH is a widely accepted strengthening of the P \n",

Our main contribution is a complete characterization, up to logarithmic factors, of the minimax regret in terms of the auction's transparency, which regulates the amount of information on competing bids disclosed by the auctioneer at the end of each auction. Our results hold under different assumptions (stochastic, adversarial, and their smoothed variants) on the environment generating the bidder's valuations and competing bids. These minimax rates reveal how the interplay between transparency and the nature of the environment affects how fast one can learn to bid optimally in first-price auctions.`\n",
